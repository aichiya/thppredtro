**Review the [Compatibility Notes](https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered/#compatibility-notes)**
In particular, not all emulators or non-official hardware solutions are supported due to bugs induced from lack of accuracy. Proper bugs should be able to be replicated on official hardware or, to a lesser extent, the latest version of the BGB emulator.

**What emulator and/or hardware are you are using?**
As is relevant, please give the name and/or model number along with the software/firmware version. If possible, include the PCB revision for any hardware.

**Which patch are you using?**
Please give the name of the patch that you downloaded. If possible, please provide the patch's date-of-upload and the location of where you downloaded it. If relevant, please include the git commit of the build. Ideally you downloaded the patch from this repository. Downloading a pre-patched rom is neither condoned nor supported by the project, and bug reports related to such will receive only a minimal amount of investigation.

**What ROM base are you using?**
Please review the [Patch Info](https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered/#patch-info). Patches are intended for a copy of ROM that you lawfully own. Please state the name of your copy, and if possible, please generate and include its MD5 hash.

**How are you utilizing the patch?**
Please list any tools/accessories that are used to utilize the patch with your owned ROM copy (patching programs, retroarch, 3rd-party reproduction hardware, etc). Please provide a version number if possible.

**What version of this project are you using?**
Please indicate the exact version number from the main screen.

**What is the problem you encountered?**
Describe the erroneous behavior in a concise and detailed manner. Leave little ambiguity. Include as much surrounding context as you possibly can as well as a description of the game state leading-up to the problem. Your description should ideally contain enough information that the problem could feasibly be replicated.

**Expected behavior**
Write a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Is it possible to reproduce the problem?**
If so, please list the exact steps taken to reproduce the erroneous behavior.
Example:
1. Go to '...'
2. Talk to '....'
3. Press '....'
4. See error

**Screenshots/Video**
If applicable, attach screenshots or video you've taken to help explain your problem.

**SAV file or Save States**
Attaching your raw .sav file and/or a BGB save state file is also helpful (but not required).

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
